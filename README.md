# Decision-Space
Creating a visualization to display how science and policy relate when making ESA listing decisions

drafting sandbox.R
This my development file, to play with visualizations before adding them to the production file. It is not a shiny application, so it is not interactive, but show how I imagine the visualizations will look prior to including user interaction.

DecisionSpaceShinyTest
The app files in this folder are for playing around with the shiny app gui. They do not contain the production visualizations. The first app.r file in this folder contains an idea for the eventual tabs in the production shiny app. The app.r file in the ..._CoPilot file is an exploration of how to construct the gui with assistance from Microsoft CoPilot.

The files in ESA_Decision_Visualization are the production files intended for eventual release. The app.r file here is in development, and still requires more inclusion of the visualizations developed in 'drafting sandbox.r' and the gui design from the ...Test files.
